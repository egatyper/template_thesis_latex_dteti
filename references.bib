  abstract = {E-books are widely used as an important resource in learning. The most common way to use e-books is to incorporate them while a learning interaction is in progress. However, some learning styles are better supported inversely: e-books take the lead and are used to initiate and bind learning communications to the topics in focus. Unfortunately, existing e-book formats cannot accommodate this need effectively, potentially causing learning interactions to lose grip on the intended discussion framework. Inability to bind a conversation with the materials in the first place can also introduce overhead cost to the readers due to the burden of bringing the materials into the discussion.
              In this work, we add the capability of e-books to serve as an interaction platform. An e-book is considered as a collection of objects indicating topics of learning discussions. Asynchronous conversation is anchored to one or more topic, and defined by a context that specifies participants and communications among them. Communication is modeled after a reactive mechanism by using event-action pairs. The proposed framework also accommodates dynamics within discussions, as well as structured discussions commonly found in many learning environments.},

  abstract = {Background: Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, ``Depression in College Students,'' as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67{\%} female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93{\%}, 54/58), and Caucasian (79{\%}, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83{\%} (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17{\%} attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT. },

  abstract       = {A Knowledge Graph (KG), which structurally represents entities (nodes) and relationships (edges), offers a powerful and flexible approach to knowledge representation in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). KGs have been increasingly applied in various domains—such as natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems, knowledge search, and medical diagnostics—spurring continuous research on effective methods for their construction and maintenance. Recently, efforts to combine large language models (LLMs), particularly those aimed at managing hallucination symptoms, with KGs have gained attention. Consequently, new approaches have emerged in each phase of KG development, including Extraction, Learning Paradigm, and Evaluation Methodology. In this paper, we focus on major publications released after 2022 to systematically examine the process of KG construction along three core dimensions: Extraction, Learning Paradigm, and Evaluation Methodology. Specifically, we investigate (1) large-scale data preprocessing and multimodal extraction techniques in the KG Extraction domain, (2) the refinement of traditional embedding methods and the application of cutting-edge techniques—such as Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and LLMs—in the KG Learning domain, and (3) both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics in the KG Evaluation domain, as well as various approaches to ensure interpretability and reliability.},
